Calp is primarily a program for loading  calendar files  (.ics's) from
drendering  them in  different formats.  The goal  is however  to also
support  fancy  filtering,  an  edit server,  and more.  The currently
working  frontends  is  the  HTML-frontend,  which  have the  two main
modes  of a  month-by-month in  "week" view,  or a  table of  a single
month,  and  the  terminal  frontend.  The  terminatend is  mostly for
debugging purposes, but it's quite usable still.

Configuration  is  set  in  ~/.config/calp/config.scm.  Set  at  least
calendar-files with something like:
	(set-config! 'calendar-files (glob "~/calendars/*")).
Both single calendar files, and vdir's  are supported,  see vdirsyncer
and ikhal. Then run
	./main --help
to see how to start the different modes.

Contributing
------------
Easiest  is  to  open  issues  at https://github.com/HugoNikanor/calp.
But patches and the like can also be mailed to <hugo@lysator.liu.se>

Requirements & Dependencies
---------------------------
For  basic  functionallity  guile-2.2  or  greater  should  be  enough
(tested to work with guile-3.0). You  do however  need to  supply your
own calendar files. I recommend vdirsyncer  for fetching  local copies
from all over the internet.

The zoneinfo data [TZ] is in the public domain [TZLIC].

Standards and specifications
----------------------------
- RFC 5545 (iCalendar)
- RFC 6321 (xCal)
- Vdir Storage Format [VDIR]

Building
--------
Since   guile   is  primarily   a  scripting   language  no   explicit
compilation  step  is  required.  Just  run  module/main.scm  and  the
appropriate modules will be compiled  (guile will  tell you  what it's
doing). For building this README, run
	./main text < README.in | sed "s/2020-07-17/`date -I`/" > README

Techical Details
----------------
- Internally all weeks start on sunday, which is repsenented as `0'.
