@section Cryptographic and Hash Procedures

This module links libcrypto, exposing some hash procedures.

@defun sha256 message
Calculate the sha256-sum of @var{message}. The message can either be a
bytevector or a string (in which case it will de encoded as UTF-8).

Returns the checksum as a bytevector.
@end defun

@defun checksum->string message-digest [port]
Generates a hex digest string from a checksum (generated by
@code{sha256}). The checksum is written to @var{port} if given, or
returned as a string otherwise.
@end defun
