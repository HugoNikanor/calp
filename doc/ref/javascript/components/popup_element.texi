@deftp {Web Component for VEvent} PopupElement
@wcindex <popup-element>
@wcindex popup-element
@code{<popup-element>}

A (small) floating window containing information, which can be dragged
arround. Consists of a navigation bar with a few buttons for
controlling the window, which also works as a drag handle, along with
an area for contents, which can be resized by the user.

Currently tightly coupled to VEvent's, since their color
profile is derived from their owning events calendar, and they have
action buttons for the event in their navigation bar.
