@subsection vevent

@deftp {Abstract Web Component} ComponentVEvent {uid: string?}

@c TODO what is done in the default constructor,
@c and the default connectedCallback

This registeres itself, but doesn't redraw
We do however redraw in connectedCallback

@deftypeivar ComponentVEvent uid uid
@end deftypeivar

@deftypeivar ComponentVEvent {HTMLTemplateElement?} template
@end deftypeivar

@deftypemethod ComponentVEvent void redraw (data: VEvent)
While abstract for this, @emph{must} be overridden for everyone else
@end deftypemethod
@end deftp

Note that many of these assume that their initial children are
configured specifically, that is however not completely documented.
