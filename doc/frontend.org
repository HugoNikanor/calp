** Javascript "components"

*** input-list
file:../static/input_list.js

All elements having 'input-list' ∈ =class=

Direct children must all have 'unit' ∈ =class=
One direct child must have 'final' ∈ =class=

binds =get_value= on instances, by default returning the value
of all =<input/>= tags joined by =,=. This can be overwritten with
- =data-joinby= :: Alternative character to join by
- =data-bindby= :: replacement for get_value

TODO: instead, override value?

=addEventList('input',= is overwritten, registering the listener for all input
elements.

*** Popup
Handles popup. Currently rather specific

*** Dragable
file:../static/dragable.js

Manually apply =bind_popup_control= to the statusbar of a floating "window".
Nothing is required from the component, but the "window" must have
'popup-container' ∈ =class=
